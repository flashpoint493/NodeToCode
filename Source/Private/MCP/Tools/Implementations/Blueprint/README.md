# Blueprint MCP Tools

This directory contains MCP tools for interacting with Blueprint assets in Unreal Engine. These tools provide comprehensive functionality for Blueprint manipulation, inspection, and organization.

## Overview

Blueprint tools are organized into the following categories:

- **[Analysis/](Analysis/)** - Tools for inspecting and analyzing Blueprint content
- **[Functions/](Functions/)** - Tools for creating and managing Blueprint functions
- **[Variables/](Variables/)** - Tools for creating variables and searching variable types
- **[Graph/](Graph/)** - Tools for manipulating nodes and connections in Blueprint graphs
- **[Organization/](Organization/)** - Tools for tagging and organizing Blueprint graphs

## Common Patterns

All Blueprint tools:
- Require Game Thread execution (they interact with Unreal Editor APIs)
- Support both focused Blueprint operations and explicit Blueprint path targeting
- Include comprehensive error handling and validation
- Return detailed metadata about operations performed

## Integration with NodeToCode

These tools integrate with NodeToCode's core functionality:
- Use `FN2CEditorIntegration` for accessing focused Blueprint context
- Leverage `FN2CNodeCollector` and `FN2CNodeTranslator` for Blueprint serialization
- Support the N2CJSON format for Blueprint representation

## Examples

### Working with the Focused Blueprint
Many tools can operate on the currently focused Blueprint without requiring an explicit path:

```bash
# Get the focused Blueprint
curl -X POST http://localhost:27000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "get-focused-blueprint",
      "arguments": {}
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Specifying a Blueprint Path
Tools also support explicit Blueprint paths for automation:

```bash
# List functions in a specific Blueprint
curl -X POST http://localhost:27000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list-blueprint-functions",
      "arguments": {
        "blueprintPath": "/Game/Blueprints/BP_PlayerCharacter"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Blueprint Context**: Always check if a Blueprint is focused before operations
2. **Path Validation**: Validate Blueprint paths to ensure they exist and are valid
3. **Transaction Support**: Use Unreal's transaction system for undo/redo support
4. **Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
5. **Metadata Return**: Include relevant metadata (GUIDs, paths, counts) in responses
